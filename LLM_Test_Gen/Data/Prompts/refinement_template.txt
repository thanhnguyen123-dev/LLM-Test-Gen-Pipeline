    The following Java test case fails to compile. Please correct the code so that it compiles under JDK 8 + JUnit 4.
    - Do not remove existing test assertions, unless they are incorrect and hinders the test from running.
    - Fix missing imports, missing semicolons, incorrect variable names, mismatched braces, etc.
    - Assume the SUT (System Under Test) classes are already on the classpath.
